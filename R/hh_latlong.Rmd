### Introduction
As a result of the synthetic population analysis, a certain number of households exist within each TAZ. Each one of those households were assigned the same position as the centroid of the TAZ in which they reside in. For exampe, if a TAZ were to have 2000 households, all 2000 would be located in the exact same spot. Of course this is unrealistic, and to help reduce further error in future analyses, new geographic coordinates will be assigned to each household id.

### Address Points and Parcel Centroids
The new coordinates for the households are based on address points within the same TAZ. The address points dataset was found on AGRC (https://gis.utah.gov/data/location/address-data/). The address points were then uploaded into QGIS and their latitude and longitude were determined. A joint analysis was run between the WFRC GIS TAZ file and the points, creating a list of address coordninates at the TAZ level.

According to the synthetic households, there are 57 TAZs that have household ids that are not shown in the Address Points dataset. Therefore, in these cases, parcel coordinates will be used. 

The parcel dataset was found on AGRC as well
(https://gis.utah.gov/data/cadastre/parcels/). Then, like the Address Points, a joint analysis was run between the parcel centroid points and the TAZ file.

The coordinate system (CRS) that was used in the GIS calculations of the latitude and longitude points was WGS 84. The TAZ centroids, the address points, and the parcel centroids are in the same coordinate system.

```{r files}
#the synthetic population and address and parcel datasets are read into the file
#we only read in the residential type addresses
house <- read_csv("data/synthetic_households2.csv")
parcel <- read_csv("data/parcel2.csv")
  colnames(parcel)[1] <- "TAZ"
address <- read_csv("data/AddressCoordinates.csv") %>%
  filter(PtType == "Residential")
  colnames(address)[1] <- "TAZ"
  
#read and filter the taz centroid dataset to be in the correct format
tazcent <- read_csv("data/tazcentroids.csv") %>%
  arrange(TAZID) %>%
  filter(CO_FIPS > 0) %>%
  mutate(TAZ = as.character(TAZID))
```

The parcel dataset also isn't complete, and some TAZs do not have coordinates. In these rare cases (about 10), the TAZ centroid is used for the household coordinate. We will update the parcel table to include this minor addition.

```{r}
#read in the taz inputs because I don't want to change the one from above
taz <- read_csv("data/tazcentroids.csv") %>%
  arrange(TAZID) %>%
  filter(CO_FIPS > 0) %>%
  mutate(TAZ = TAZID)

#update the parcel dataset to fill in any TAZs that don't have coordinate information
parcel <- left_join(parcel,taz,by = "TAZ") %>%
  mutate(
    xcoord = ifelse(is.na(xcoord.x), xcoord.y, xcoord.x),
    ycoord = ifelse(is.na(ycoord.x), ycoord.y, ycoord.x),
    CO_FIPS = CO_FIPS.x
  ) %>%
  select(TAZ,CO_FIPS,PARCEL_ID,OWN_TYPE,xcoord,ycoord)
```

### New Household Coordinates
Since there is no knowledge of the household location behond the TAZ in which they are located, a random address point within the same TAZ is assigned to each household. If there are more households than address points in the same TAZ, the same address is used amoung the multiple household ids. (This is reasonable in some cases as many homes are built on top of each other, like with appartment buildings.) 

#### Assigning Household Coordinates
In order to accomplish the task of assigning households address point coordinates, first the total number of households in each TAZ must be determined. Also, it is important to know which of the TAZs do have households but don't have address points, so that later on parcel coordinates can be assigned to them.

```{r}
#determine the total number of households per TAZ
tothh <- house %>%
  arrange(TAZ) %>% mutate(tot_hh = 1) %>% select(TAZ, tot_hh)%>%
  group_by(TAZ) %>% summarize_all("sum")
p <- data.frame(TAZ = (1:2881))

#display TAZs with no households as the value of 0
tothh <- left_join(p, tothh, by = "TAZ") 
tothh[is.na(tothh)] <- 0

#display all TAZs, so that the loop in the next step doesn't break
address <- left_join(p,address, by = "TAZ")
  address[is.na(address)] <- 0
parcel <- left_join(p,parcel, by = "TAZ")
  parcel[is.na(parcel)] <- 0

#create a table that has the third column to the tothh table
col3 <- address %>%
  select(TAZ, CO_FIPS)%>%
  group_by(TAZ) %>% summarize_all("sum") %>%
  filter(CO_FIPS == 0)

#add the CO_FIPS sum to the tothh table (displays a 0 where no address coordinates exist; allows the loop to get coordinates from parcel dataset instead)
tothh <- left_join(tothh,col3, by = "TAZ") %>% select(TAZ,tot_hh,CO_FIPS)
  tothh[is.na(tothh)] <- 1
```

Then, by spliting up the address and parcel tables into separate vectors for each TAZ, and using a loop, a set of coordinates for the right amount of households per TAZ can be determined.The separted vectors with added coordinates are then joined into a table.

```{r}
#separate the address point data table into a set of vectors for each TAZ
address <- address %>% arrange(TAZ) %>% select(TAZ, xcoord, ycoord)
splitt <- split(address,address$TAZ)

#separate the parcel data table into a set of vectors for each TAZ
parcel <- parcel %>% arrange(TAZ) %>% select(TAZ, xcoord, ycoord)
splitt2 <- split(parcel,parcel$TAZ)

#a loop that determines the coordinates for each TAZ based on the number of households per TAZ; use of the sample function; a joint table is continually updated
i = 1
while (i <= 2881){
  n = tothh[i,2]
  m = tothh[i,3]
  testsam <- sample_n(splitt[[i]], n, replace = TRUE)
  testsam2 <- sample_n(splitt2[[i]], n, replace = TRUE)
  ifelse(i == 1, join <- sample_n(splitt[[1]], n, replace = TRUE), 
         ifelse(n != 0 & m == 0,join <- rbind(join, testsam2), join <- rbind(join,           testsam)))
  i = i + 1
}
colnames(join)[2] <- "longitude"
colnames(join)[3] <- "latitude"
```

A table of randomly selected address point coordinates has been created, based on the correct amount of values needed for the households.

#### Joining Tables
In order to combine the address point coordinates dataset created in the previous step with the household dataset, a lot of memory is required. For some reason, by turning the TAZ values into a string and joining them based on their index, it easier to merge the two tables. 

```{r table organization}
#organize the household dataset by numbering each TAZ for each household using Index
house2 <- house %>%
  arrange(TAZ) %>% 
  mutate(TAZ = as.character(TAZ)) %>% group_by(TAZ) %>%
  mutate(Index = 1:n(), index = as.character(Index), tazcom = paste(TAZ, index)) %>%
  select(tazcom, index, household_id,PUMA,TRACT,hhsize,HHINCADJ,num_workers,HHT,VEHICL,income,digits,TAZ)

#organize the address point dataset by numbering each TAZ for each address point using Index
address2 <- join %>%
  mutate(TAZ = as.character(TAZ)) %>% group_by(TAZ) %>%
  mutate(Index = 1:n(), index = as.character(Index), tazcom = paste(TAZ, index)) %>%
  select(tazcom, longitude, latitude)
```

#### Household Coordinates Table
The table below shows the final result of the household coordinates in longitude and latitude. It is a joint table of the updated address point coordinates and the house data table.The synthetic housholds csv is also updated to include x and y coordinates.

```{r}
#join the address point and house tables by the indexing of the TAZ, thus assigning coordinates to the households
hhcoord <- left_join(house2, address2, by = "tazcom") %>% select(household_id,TAZ.x,PUMA,TRACT,hhsize,HHINCADJ,num_workers,HHT,VEHICL,income,digits,longitude,latitude) %>%
  arrange(household_id)
colnames(hhcoord)[2] <- "TAZ"
  
#the coordinate table
hhcoord2 <- hhcoord %>%
  select(household_id,TAZ,longitude,latitude)

#display the final table of the household coordinates and create/update the csvs
paged_table(hhcoord2)
write_csv(hhcoord2, "hhcoord.csv")
write_csv(hhcoord, "data/synthetic_households_xy.csv")
```

### Map Comparison
Using the WFRC GIS TAZ file, we can display the poloygon of any TAZ we want on a map. Then, we can compare two maps: one with the position of the households before assigning address point coordinates and one after assigning the address point coordinates. 

First we pick the TAZ we want to compare, as long as it exists within the sythetic population data. Most numbers under 2869 will work. 

Some good TAZ ids: 14-water,123-distribution, 141-large taz, 2445-lots of hhs, 1231-taz centroid overused

```{r taz pick}
#pick the wanted taz id
tazid <- "14"

#if a random taz is wanted
#tazid <- as.character(floor(runif(1, min=0, max=2869)))
#print(tazid)
```

#### TAZ Map Features
Next we read in the TAZ GIS file and its centroid, the updated position of the old households.
```{r old coord}
#read in the gis file for the taz polygons
taz <- st_read("data/taz.geojson") %>% 
  mutate(TAZ = as.character(TAZID)) %>%
  filter(CO_FIPS > 0) %>%
  filter(TAZ == tazid) %>%
  select(TAZ)

#store the coordinates of the taz centroid based households
hhcoord1 <- left_join(hhcoord, tazcent, by = "TAZ")
tazc <- hhcoord1 %>%
  filter(TAZ == tazid) %>%
  select(TAZ, household_id, xcoord, ycoord)
colnames(tazc)[3] = ("longitude")
colnames(tazc)[4] = ("latitude")
```

#### Household Map Features
Then, using the new household coordinate table, we get the coordinates of the new household positions.
```{r new coord}
#get coordinates for households
addressc <- hhcoord %>%
  filter(TAZ == tazid) %>%
  select(TAZ,household_id, longitude, latitude)
```

#### Maps Displayed
Finally, a comparison map can be seen. The left showing the household coordinates before this analysis, and the right showing the position of the households after this analysis.The positioning of the new coordinates for the households are clearly in more reasonable spots. Also, the table below each map shows the exact coordinates of each household.

```{r tazmap}
#this map shows the taz polygon and its centroid
map1 <- leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %>%
  addPolygons(data = taz, group = "TAZ") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data = tazc, group = "TAZC") %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c("TAZ", "TAZC"))

#this map shows the household's new coordinates
map2 <- leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %>%
  addPolygons(data = taz, group = "TAZ") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data = addressc, group = "ADDRESSC") %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c("TAZ","ADDRESSC"))

#show the maps synchronized
sync(map1,map2)
```

```{r table, echo = FALSE}
#display the table side by side
kable(tazc) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "float_left")
kable(addressc) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "right")
```
