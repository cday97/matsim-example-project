MATSim requires data for each facility within each TAZ. Each facility needs a specific coordinate. Using address point data, coordinates corresponding to commercial or other type addresses are given to each facility. A unique Facility ID is also given to each point. The AddressPoints.csv is used to assign coordinates to each facility.

The AddressPoints.csv is a modified version of the AddressCoordinates.csv (found in branch population_wfrc on Github), and was created in QGIS by running a joint analysis of the AddressCoordinates.csv and Parcel information from AGRC.  It includes all building types. It also includes owner type, shape area, and parcel id information.

```{r}
#read in the important files
#should we include Agricultural addresses?
fac <- read_csv("data/AddressPoints.csv") %>%
  filter(PtType == "Commercial" | PtType == "Other")
         #| PtType == "Agricultural") %>%
  colnames(fac)[1] <- "TAZ"
    
tazc <- read_csv("data/tazcentroids.csv") %>%
  arrange(TAZID)
  colnames(tazc)[1] <- "TAZ"
```

After reading in the address and TAZ centroid files, a table is created to display the coordinates of all Facility IDs. Business type is a combination of the Owner and Parcel type categories. If it is blank, "Private Other" is the default value given. 

```{r}
#a table that creates and organizes facility ids, business type, taz, and coordinates
facility <- left_join(tazc, fac, by = "TAZ") %>%
  mutate(facility_id = 1:n(),
         own_type = ifelse(is.na(OWN_TYPE),"Private", OWN_TYPE),
         pt_type = ifelse(is.na(PtType), "Other", PtType),
         business_type = paste(own_type, pt_type),
         lat = ifelse(is.na(xcoord.y), xcoord.x, xcoord.y),
         lon = ifelse(is.na(ycoord.y), ycoord.x, ycoord.y)) %>%
  select(facility_id, TAZ, business_type, lon, lat)

#a table displaying the result
paged_table(facility)
```

Finally, we write the csv file that will be used in the MATSim project.

```{r}
write_csv(facility,"data/facility_ids.csv")
```
